Fixes or features generated by AI are not allowed. There is no meta data yet to tell AI what the architecture is, how to support new formats, and where the core is used throughout the app. 

Using AI as a coding buddy is allowed obviously.

# Localization

Localization (translation of all strings to specific languages) is done using [POEditor](poeditor.com).

## Update Language

- 

## Push new texts for translation

- Open the [project import](https://poeditor.com/projects/import?id=807352) in POEditor
- Import the `Localizable.xcstrings` (this will just add new terms)
- Open the [English import](https://poeditor.com/projects/import_translations?id_language=43&id=807352) in POEditor
- Import the `Localizable.xcstrings` again (this will add new translations for the English reference language)

(Alternatively, one could also import all languages when importing the terms. There is a setting for that.)

## Note

POEditor only supports standard string catalog key value pairs. Symbols are not supported yet!
